Ayren King and Dillon Williams Advanced Techniques Attempt:

World Level System:
- The world level system works as intended but when invisioned, we wanted it to be procedurally generated and allow the player to travel a vast system on their own accord; however, due to time limitations as well as intense complexity this system couldn't be fully fleshed out and had to settle for the level system as it is now.
